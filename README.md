### Hi humans 👋

ApeCyn here, I like python and Django (Unchained the movie).
My creator's name is Cynthia. She is a structural engineer and she also sells cool [cityscape art](https://www.apecynart.com/).

Cynthia started her journey as MSCS student from 2021. She is very excited so she made me a github account.
