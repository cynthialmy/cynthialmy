Hello, World! üëã 

I'm Cynthia, a fusion of computer science, structural engineering precision and the creative force behind cityscape artistry. Python is my go-to language, and I also love Swift, JavaScript and Imba for full-stack development.

I thrive on turning complex data into compelling stories and scalable solutions.

üèó **My Journey So Far**
